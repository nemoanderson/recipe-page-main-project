## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was all about the tables. I had limited knowledge of the different styling you can do with tables. I had to really think about how to get those lines an at first tought about <hr> tag but then after checking out its styling, I notices that tables have borders like every other element so I decided to use bottom border. There was more borders than there neede to be so, I hid it with color. Finding how to exploit just a single border was difficult but this led to my next learned point. 

Nth and marker. Able to select a specific object and change it one part of the object. Unknown to myself at the time, being able to change <ul> and <ol> puzzled me until I learned about the use of nth and the use of ::marker. I was familiar of nth but never got to use it until now but ::marker was new to me and searching for the solution of changing the numbers and bullet color brought me to that. 

### Continued development

After learning about vanilla css, I'm looking to learn bootstrap and use what I learn to apply it to this project and others.
